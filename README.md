# Open Hackathon - Hackthon of Hackathons

**:pushpin: Philosophy**

> Without percussion tempo, the artist cannot leave his soul in the flow.

When combined with a *strong technical background* and *faith*, focused on one thing, a brand new *destructive* technology is **inevitable**.

The best way to overcome  [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) which is one of the factors that affect our productivity is **competitions**.

That's the reason, hackathons are best way of give away off imposter syndrome for us.

*We need inspiration, motivation and vision.*

> A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is a design sprint-like event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, and others, often including subject-matter-experts, collaborate intensively on software projects - Wikipedia

- [x] Hackathons are designed for specific purposes, that's killing our free spirit.
> Using specific language, framework, API or build an app for cause or proposal

- [x] In the competition, projects are evaluated only by the jury. The fact that they are really successful is evaluated by their proximity to the hackathon rules and expectations.
> A successful project can be attributed to failing out of scope.

- [x] Competitions are not designed for launch new ideas to global/local market.

- [x] Project ideas can be unique and inconvenient to the market. But the competition is not accessible outside.

*That's why we'll **fix** hackathon things.*
