When combined with a *strong technical background* and *faith*, focused on one thing, a brand new *destructive* technology is **inevitable**.

The best way to overcome  [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) which is one of the factors that affect our productivity is **competitions**.

That's the reason, hackathons are best way of give away off imposter syndrome for us.

*We need inspiration, motivation and vision.*
